# Display space-x Data
The goal is to display datas from space-X API with a JS framework.
This project take place as a student in MyDigitalSchool Paris.
In this repo I'll try to do the same app with the 3 main JavaScript frameworks.
Let's start with Angular, followed by Vue3, then finish with React.
Each will use tailwindCss.
If I can manage it, I'll may do a docker to get used to it.

### Angular
Using AngularCLI to generate, scss for styles 

### Vue3
Using yarn to initialize the project 

### React
Using yarn too
